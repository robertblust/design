# @robertblust/design

The design system shared by [blust.ch](https://blust.ch),
[companygraph.io](https://companygraph.io) and [guestgraph.io](https://guestgraph.io).

## The rule

> If a visitor downloads it and every copy is the same, it is generated into the
> repository and committed.
> If only CI runs it, it is imported from the package.
> If a visitor downloads it but every copy legitimately differs, only its *shape* is
> shared — as an assertion, not as bytes.

The three sites are static, ship no external assets, and are served straight from their
repository trees by GitHub Pages. So this package is **never a runtime dependency of a
published page**. It is a `devDependency` that copies files into a site and lends that
site's suite a few checks.

## In a site

```jsonc
// design.config.json
{ "groups": ["fonts", "stage"] }   // guestgraph.io takes ["fonts"] — it draws no graph
```

```jsonc
// package.json
"scripts": {
  "design": "design sync",
  "design:check": "design sync --check"
},
"devDependencies": { "@robertblust/design": "0.1.0" }   // exact, never ^
```

`npm run design:check` runs in CI after `npm ci` and before `npm run verify`.

## A warning about `stage.js`

`stage.js` is the one shared file no deck loads — a deck draws static SVG and has to open
from `file://` with no network. **Never link a deck to `stage.js` or `stage.css`.** They
are reached only by served prose pages, through a plain `<link>` and `<script src>`.

## Releasing

Tag, and let the workflow publish. Every release needs notes: Dependabot renders them into
the pull request it opens in three repositories, and that pull request is the only thing
telling someone there what changed.

A change to any synced file is at least a **minor** — it makes every site's committed copy
stale. A change needing a site edit beyond `npm run design` is a **major**.
